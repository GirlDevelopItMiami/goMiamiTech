    <img style="background: white" src="./Miami-Venture-Capital-News_files/logo.png">
    <p> RealConnex, a B2B real estate deal-making platform, announced  the completion of its $3.5 million Series A financing round led by Star Capital, a U.S.-based investment group. The funding will be used to accelerate the domestic rollout, drive the company's global expansion and hire top talent, said RealConnex CEO Roy Abrams, who is based in Miami.</p>

<p>RealConnex's platform links investors, lenders, developers, advisors and other service providers to capital, services, opportunities and each other, providing a technology-driven alternative to the traditional real estate deal-making process that relies on pre-formed relationships and personal connections, the company said in its news release. The company is headquartered in New York with operations in Miami.</p>
